# Logarithmic_Strain_Space-dealii
C++ code using the deal.ii library for the transformation into the logarithmic strain space

## ToDo
* combine the three steps (pre, call to small strain material model, post) into as single call and e.g. put the second step into a function pointer (don't know how in combination with template, ...)
